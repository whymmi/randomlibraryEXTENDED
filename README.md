# randomlibraryEXTENDED
This is a project i am working on. It helps me elarn a lot more about functions.



What is it?

 --> This is a simple library-like project i am working on where you can download the main.py file and import * to your project to have some useful examples.
    With this project i aim to make the procces of generating random numbers, letters , ints , hashses and more easier for people.Even tho its not a difficult process 
    to do without these functions i still find it good to use on certain projects.

Is this all?

  --> No i plan on adding more features to this. like generating hashes, hexidecimal numbers and more.


When will it be finished?

  -->It is a fairly small project and very easy and i plan on using it on my next project so i will probably finish it very soon
  Just gonna take 3-5 buissness days(joke)

How to use?
--> well first you have to
from main import * (it would be better if you renamed the file before adding it to your project directory because you probably already have a main.py file)

for now the avalable functions are
randomINT() -> prints a random interger like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 (i plan on making the user able to select between any ints he wants )

randomFLOAT(x) -> this function takes an argument and prints a random float. the argument it takes is an int like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and it print a random float with as many decimal points as the argument

EXAMPLES------RESULTS
randomINT() -> 1
randomFLOAT(1)-> 1.4
                    1 Decimal point since i put 1 as an argument
